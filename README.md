# Multiple-Objects-Detection-in-Drone-Images-using-ensemble-learning-
Drones are used widely in various fields such as security monitoring, traffic control, party photos etc. There are numerous objects present in every image captured by a drone. The detection of objects present in an image captured by a drone can solve real-world problems.

The retinaNet model is present as a separate jupyter notebook file and the 5 files named "model1" to "model5" represent the 5 fasterRCNN models trained for our VISDRAONE dataset with each file training 2 distinct classes.
